# OARI-Maintain

This project will build off of a capstone project idea by Pat Broders, Justin Kawaja, and Chris Harnett, that will take the idea of a house maintenance program, but shift it to the maintenance of CNA's equipment such as drones, and determine if the present weather is suitable for using such equipment in the given location.
