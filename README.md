# OARI-Maintain

This project will build off of a capstone project idea by Pat Broders, Justin Kawaja, and Chris Harnett, that will take the idea of a house maintenance program, but shift it to the maintenance of CNA's equipment such as drones. This web app will allow the user to have all their drones, equipment, and software details in one application. The user will be able to add, edit, and delete any of their equipment, check the weather for a specific area, and compare to their equipment requirements if it is suitable for use. There is a maintenance section that will allow the user to input upcoming maintenance, and any software added will automatically go to the maintenance schedule to allow for automatic renewal maintenance. The maintenance schedule is going to try to be connected to Microsoft Oauth, Azore Portal, to allow the user to connect the maintenance schedule to their outlook and team calenders, and receive alerts for upcoming maintenance (however this is yet to be fully functional as waiting on certain approvals). There is a section that will allow the user to check out a piece of equipment, and check in, and view all previously checked out equipment and any notes the previous user may have left behind.
